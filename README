The goal of this project is to implement a functioning monitor
for Live for Speed OutGauge on the Arduino microcontroller
architecture.

Possible uses could be
 - a simple LCD display with live game data (working!)
 - a car gauge cluster with live game data
 - ?
 - PROFIT

My development environment
--------------------------

 - Ubuntu 11.10 Arduino IDE
 - Arduino Mega2560
 - Ethernet Shield
 - Hitachi HD44780 compatible 20x4 LCD display

How to get it to work
---------------------

Clone this project under your sketch directory as DisplayTest1 and
open it in Arduino IDE.

  cd ~/sketchbook
  git clone git://github.com/jlinnosa/arduino-lfs-outgauge-monitor.git DisplayTest1
